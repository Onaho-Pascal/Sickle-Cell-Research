# Evaluating Hydroxyureaâ€™s Non-HbF-Related Impacts on Gene Expression and Pathways in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: An RNA-Seq Analysis
**N.B: This study has been carried out before, and the raw and normalized count data were retrieved from the GEO database. However, I custom structured the meta data using the individual data samples provided, and reproduced the results of the study on my own and did not copy from the research article itself. The R-script was entirely generated by me**  
This study specifically examined HCâ€™s non-HbF (fetal hemoglobin) related impacts, providing insight into how HC affects genes and pathways critical to SCD pathophysiology in pediatric patients.  
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my process so far:  
## Background and Objective
Hydroxyurea (HU) isa very important medication in the management of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD), especially because of its ability to induce fetal hemoglobin (HbF) and reduce vaso-occlusive crises. However, beyond HbF induction, HUâ€™s broader molecular effects, especially in pediatric patients, remain incompletely understood. This project aimed to evaluate the non-HbF-related impacts of HU on global gene expression and biological pathways in pediatric SCD patients using RNA-Seq data. By leveraging publicly available data and performing independent analyses, this work explored how HU may modulate immune and stress response pathways, thereby contributing to its therapeutic efficacy.
## Data Overview
**Dataset**: GSE254951 (NCBI GEO)  
**Samples**: 50 whole blood samples from 25 pediatric SCD patients   
**Conditions**:   
1)Pre-HU (before Hydroxyurea)  
2)HU-MTD (after maximum tolerated dose)  
**Format**: Raw and normalized count data (Ensembl gene IDs). Customized
## ðŸ§¬ Data Exploration and Preprocessing  
* Dataset Loading and Preparation:
1. Imported the raw RNA-Seq counts data into R.
2. Assigned row names as gene identifiers for easier manipulation and analysis.
3. The sample metadata was custom-structured for compatibility with DESeq2
4. Quality alignment between counts and metadata was validated.
* Differential Gene Expression Analysis:
1. DESeq2 was used to identify differentially expressed genes between HU-MTD and Pre-HU conditions.
2. Shrinkage of log2 fold changes was performed using apeglm to obtain stabilized effect sizes.
3. Significant genes were filtered using p-value < 0.05 and |log2FoldChange| > 1.5.

ðŸ“Š Visualizations:
1) Volcano Plot:
Through this plot, the upregulated and downregulated genes were highlighted post HU treatment. 

2) PCA Plot:
Revealed clear separation between Pre-HU and HU-MTD samples, suggesting systemic transcriptomic changes post-treatment.


## Functional Enrichment Analysis
**Steps taken:** 
After getting the DESeq2 results in a CSV file, a combination of IF(AND) functions and conditional formatting were used to select for upregulated and downregulated genes.  
The conditions were, **if log2FoldChange > 1 & padj < 0.05, then genes were upregulated. If log2FoldChange < -1 & padj < 0.05, then genes were downregulated.**
Then both up and down-regulated genes were filtered and transfered to different ".txt" files. These files were then passed into R in order to 
get the pathways they represent.

Enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in pediatric sickle cell patients treated with Hydroxyurea at maximum tolerated dose revealed significant enrichment of processes related to protein folding and cellular stress responses, including heat shock pathways. Additionally, pathways involved in oxidative stress management and interleukin-8 mediated inflammatory signaling were highlighted. These findings suggest that Hydroxyurea may exert non-HbF-related effects by modulating oxidative stress and immune homeostasis, potentially contributing to its overall therapeutic profile. Downregulated genes were significantly enriched for biological processes involved in adaptive immune signaling, particularly those related to T-cell activation, receptor-mediated signaling, and lymphocyte differentiation. These results suggest that Hydroxyurea at maximum tolerated dose may exert immunomodulatory effects by suppressing T-cell mediated responses in pediatric SCD patients. Such effects could contribute to reduced inflammation or immune-related complications in SCD, representing potential non-HbF-mediated therapeutic actions of Hydroxyurea
