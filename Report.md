# Evaluating Hydroxyureaâ€™s Non-HbF-Related Impacts on Gene Expression and Pathways in Pediatric Sickle Cell Disease: An RNA-Seq Analysis
**N.B: This study has been carried out before, and the raw and normalized count data were retrieved from the GEO database. However, I custom structured the meta data using the individual data samples provided, and reproduced the results of the study on my own and did not copy from the research article itself. The R-script was entirely generated by me**  
This study specifically examined HCâ€™s non-HbF (fetal hemoglobin) related impacts, providing insight into how HC affects genes and pathways critical to SCD pathophysiology in pediatric patients.  
Hereâ€™s a breakdown of my process so far:  
## Data Overview
**Dataset**: GSE254951 (NCBI GEO)  
**Samples**: 50 whole blood samples from 25 pediatric SCD patients   
**Conditions**:   
1)Pre-HU (before Hydroxyurea)  
2)HU-MTD (after maximum tolerated dose)  
**Format**: Raw and normalized count data (Ensembl gene IDs). Customozied
## ðŸ§¬ Data Exploration and Preprocessing  
* Dataset Loading and Preparation:
Imported the raw RNA-Seq counts data into R.
Assigned row names as gene identifiers for easier manipulation and analysis.
Filtered out genes with low expression (less than 10 counts in at least half the samples) to focus on genes with significant read counts.
* Data Normalization and Transformation:
Applied log2 transformation to stabilize variance, an essential step for RNA-Seq data visualization and downstream analysis.
Standardized the data further with Z-scores for sample comparability, making it ready for in-depth comparisons.
ðŸ“Š Visualizations:
1) Boxplots:
Created boxplots to inspect count distribution across samples before and after normalization, helping identify any potential outliers or sample inconsistencies.

2) Histograms:
Generated histograms of raw counts and log-transformed counts for individual samples, giving a clear view of distribution shifts post-normalization.
3) Heatmap:
Visualized the expression of top genes through a heatmap, capturing gene expression patterns across all samples and highlighting potentially significant expression clusters affected by HC.

## Differential Expression Analysis

## Functional Enrichment Analysis
Enrichment analysis of upregulated genes in pediatric sickle cell patients treated with Hydroxyurea at maximum tolerated dose revealed significant enrichment of processes related to protein folding and cellular stress responses, including heat shock pathways. Additionally, pathways involved in oxidative stress management and interleukin-8 mediated inflammatory signaling were highlighted. These findings suggest that Hydroxyurea may exert non-HbF-related effects by modulating oxidative stress and immune homeostasis, potentially contributing to its overall therapeutic profile. Downregulated genes were significantly enriched for biological processes involved in adaptive immune signaling, particularly those related to T-cell activation, receptor-mediated signaling, and lymphocyte differentiation. These results suggest that Hydroxyurea at maximum tolerated dose may exert immunomodulatory effects by suppressing T-cell mediated responses in pediatric SCD patients. Such effects could contribute to reduced inflammation or immune-related complications in SCD, representing potential non-HbF-mediated therapeutic actions of Hydroxyurea
